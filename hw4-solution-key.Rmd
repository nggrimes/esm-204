# Sum of PV of damages between both policies
expected_value_A = .5*sum(policy_damages$damage_A1) + .5*sum(policy_damages$damage_A2)
value_B = sum(policy_damages$damage_B)

```

The expected present value of damages under Policy A are of \$`r format(round(expected_value_A/1E12), big.mark=",")` trillions. The expected present value of damages under Policy B are of \$`r format(round(value_B/1E12), big.mark=",")` trillions.

When society is risk neutral, we know society's utility function $U(m)$ (I use $m$ to denote money as the parameter in the utility function) is linear, and that $E(U(m)) = U(E(m))$. In the case of the random outcome of Policy A, $A$, $E(U(A)) = U(E(A)) = U(-\$3,023)$. For the certain outcome of Policy B, $B$, $U(B) = U(-\$787 - X)$, were $X$ is the policy cost. 

```{r}
# Let's look at the cost of the policy from 0 to 5000 trillion
x= seq(0, 5000, length.out = 100)

cost_scenario = tibble(X=x, cost_b = 787+x, cost_a=3023)

plot_4 <- ggplot(cost_scenario, aes(X, y=cost_b)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3023, color = 'mistyrose4')  +
  theme_cowplot() +
  geom_text(data = tibble(X=c(3500, 3500), cost_b = c(3200, 5200), 
                          policy = c('Policy B','Policy A')), aes(label = policy)) +
  labs(y = 'Expected PV damage $ (trillions)', x= 'X ($)')
```



Suppose the cost were zero or $X=0$, then we know that a risk neutral society would prefer Policy B since $E(U(A)) = U(E(A)) = U(-\$3,023)<U(B) = U(-\$787)$. We know this since $U(m)$ is increasing in $w$, utility is always increasing in \$.



<center>**Figure 4: Total expected cost of policy A and B under a range of policy B cost, X. **</center>
```{r , fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
plot_4
```



Society will prefer Policy B until $-\$3,023 = -\$787 - X$ or $X = \$2,236$.


# Risk averse society

If society is risk averse, then $E(U(m)) < U(E(m))$. This implies that when $X=\$2,236$, E(U(A))< U(E(A)) = U(B). Therefore, since E(U(A))<U(B) when $X=\$2301$, we can say that when society is risk averse, they would still prefer Policy B to A for costs greater than \$2,236. However, we cannot put an upper bound on those costs, since we would need to know more about the functional form of $U(m)$.
